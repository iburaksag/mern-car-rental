        description : "With the development of technology in the automotive industry, one of the questions that drivers often wonder about is What is ESP? is the question. The ESP system in vehicles has been made compulsory since 2014 and thousands of collisions have been prevented thanks to the ESP system. ESP stands for Electronic Stability Programme. This system basically checks whether the vehicle is going in the direction desired by the driver by comparing the sensors in the vehicle and the steering movement. It allows the vehicle control to be regained in a few seconds when the direction of movement of the vehicle and the movement of the steering wheel do not match. In this way, the vehicle continues to progress normally without skidding and loss of control. Before renting a car, it is recommended to check whether the vehicle has an ESP system."

        description : "There are a lot of rumors about idle. Some people argue that the vehicle consumes less fuel or does not pollute the air when idling. According to some people, idling the vehicle causes damage to the engine. There are many well-known misconceptions about idling among the public. Some of these are that idling is harmless, does not pollute the air, or saves fuel. However, the situation is exactly the opposite. Air pollution is becoming an increasingly serious problem in the world. Millions of people die every year due to health problems related to air pollution. Vehicles left idling have a major impact on air pollution. “What does idling mean?” It is important to know the correct answers to the question. “What does the idle setting mean?” The answer to the question is simply regulating the engine idle speed. The idle speed of each vehicle is different. Some models have an engine speed of 500 when idling. In some vehicles, it can go up to 1000 rpm. “What is the idle setting?” “Idle speed is the return of the idle speed to the normal value in vehicles with excessively high or low idle speed.” response can be given. In old model vehicles, the engine idle adjustment is made via the carburetor. Idle adjustment can be made by regulating the amount of air entering the engine through the adjustment screw. This setting applies to petrol vehicles. Because in diesel vehicles, the amount of fuel going to the injector and the idle speed are adjusted automatically. On newer vehicles with ECU, there is a sensor between the accelerator pedal and the throttle for idle speed adjustment."

        title : "How to Calculate Vehicle Fuel",

        description : "One of the important points of traveling especially long distances is to calculate how much the vehicle burns. In this way, you can find out how much fuel is needed for your journey, as well as calculate how far your vehicle has traveled with a tank of gasoline. Fuel calculation is an important point especially for those who are considering renting a car. Because, starting the road without knowing how many kilometers a vehicle you have not used before will travel or how much fuel it will consume can cause some problems. Therefore, fuel consumption calculation is extremely important. The risk of staying on the road many kilometers from the nearest gas station is quite high on journeys without knowing how much fuel the vehicle consumes. Calculating how much the car burns is quite easy, but it is a process that requires the same amount of attention. To calculate how much the vehicle has burned, first note how far you have traveled after refueling your vehicle. Then divide the liter value of the fuel you buy by the distance you take in kilometers. This value shows you how much fuel your vehicle consumes per kilometer. By multiplying the value you found by 100 and completing the fuel consumption calculation process, you can find out how much your vehicle has burned in 100 kilometers. For example, if you travel 450 kilometers with 60 liters of fuel, you need to divide 60 by 450. When you perform this operation, you will have the data that your vehicle consumes 0.13 liters of fuel per kilometer. When we multiply this result by 100, the value corresponding to approximately 13.3 liters is the amount of fuel your vehicle consumes in 100 kilometers."

        description : "Vehicle air conditioning is considered one of the best discoveries in the automotive industry. Especially in the hot summer months, the vehicle air conditioner makes the journey more comfortable. When the vehicle air conditioner is not working properly, it becomes inefficient. While fuel consumption increases, the interior of the vehicle does not cool as much as it should. In hot summer months, this can make long journeys particularly challenging. For this reason, car air conditioner maintenance is very important.It is recommended that those who will rent a car check the air conditioner before renting. Vehicle air conditioning failure can turn a fun and comfortable journey into an uncomfortable experience. Performing the air conditioner maintenance correctly and regularly ensures that the system works without any problems."

        title : "If Water Comes From The Exhaust",

        description : "It is perfectly normal to produce exhaust gas as a result of the normal operation of the vehicle's internal combustion engine. These gases must be discharged from the exhaust. Accumulation of gas in the engine can cause serious problems. However, it is considered a problem that different products such as water, other than gas, come out of the exhaust. In some cases, water coming from the exhaust is not considered a problem, since water is considered as a by-product of normal operation. Exhaust dripping is very common, especially in cold weather. This dripping occurs as a result of water condensation. The smell and taste of the water coming from the exhaust is very important. If the water does not have an odor or is tasteless, it is not a problem. However, if the water has a sugary smell and is sweet, it is an indication that the coolant is coming from the exhaust."
